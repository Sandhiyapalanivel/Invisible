# 🧙‍♂️ Invisible Cloak using OpenCV

## 📌 Introduction
This project is inspired by the famous **Harry Potter Invisible Cloak**.  
Using **Python, OpenCV, and NumPy**, I built a program that can detect a specific color (like a red shirt or shawl) and replace it with the background, creating the illusion of invisibility in real-time!  

## 🎯 Features
- Real-time video processing with OpenCV  
- Detects a specific color using HSV color space  
- Replaces detected region with pre-captured background  
- Works with red, pink, or other colors (with minor HSV adjustments)  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy
